# Inference Server Cache Performance Testing Suite

A toolkit for testing and benchmarking LLM inference servers and their KV Cache offload performance.

## Quick Start

| Tool | Purpose | Documentation |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **single_prompt_tester.py** | Baseline cache performance with cold start vs cached comparisons | [Docs](docs/single_prompt_tester.md) |

### Included Traces

The `traces/` directory contains **739 traces** with **59,204 requests**, including 19 traces with nested sub-agent conversations (70 sub-agents total). Generated from real Claude Code sessions captured via [claude-code-proxy](https://github.com/seifghazi/claude-code-proxy) as part of research at [WEKA](https://www.weka.io/) on the [Augmented Memory Grid](https://www.weka.io/resources/solution-brief/weka-augmented-memory-grid/) product. See [agentic-coding-analysis](https://github.com/callanjfox/agentic-coding-analysis) for the trace generation tools.

Traces include:
- **Local hash_ids** (`hash_id_scope: "local"`) — hash IDs are scoped per conversation, with sub-agents sharing the parent's namespace
- **Timing breakdown** — `api_time` (server processing) and `think_time` (client delay) per request, enabling flexible replay timing strategies
- **Sub-agent nesting** — sub-agents embedded in parent traces with their own tool/system tokens and request arrays
- **One request per turn** — no streaming/non-streaming pairing (proxy bug fixed upstream)

All traces are fully anonymized — no conversation IDs, timestamps, or real agent IDs.

| Metric | Min | P25 | Median | P75 | Max | Mean |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Requests per trace | 3 | 19 | 48 | 101 | 1,178 | 80 |
| Starting input tokens | 6,343 | 18,726 | 24,775 | 105,061 | 851,858 | 92,473 |
| Ending input tokens | 11,053 | 94,686 | 137,529 | 208,960 | 894,371 | 181,659 |
| Input tokens per request (P10/P50/P90) | 43,475 | — | 109,903 | — | 300,118 | 139,924 |
| Output tokens per request (P10/P50/P90) | 103 | — | 218 | — | 937 | 446 |
| Conversation duration (min) | 0.1 | 23 | 62 | 141 | 4,952 | 240 |
| Think time per request (s) | 0 | 6 | 10 | 30 | 78,638 | 199 |
| API time per request (s) | 1.2 | 4.4 | 6.5 | 11.0 | 300.0 | 10.2 |

#### Cache hit rates

Cache rates are computed from hash_id overlap between consecutive requests within each conversation.

| Scenario | Min | P25 | Median | P75 | Max | Mean |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Conversation-only (no warm prefix) | 61% | 92% | 96% | 97% | 100% | 93% |
| With 75% warm prefix | 67% | 93% | 96% | 97% | 100% | 94% |

**System and tools prefix impact:** Each trace includes `tool_tokens` (median ~10,500) and `system_tokens` (median ~2,600) — a combined prefix of ~15,000 tokens (median), representing ~60% of the median first-request input. In a production deployment, this prefix is shared across all conversations and stays warm in the KV cache, so the first request of any conversation gets a significant cache hit that isn't captured by the conversation-only rate above. The "75% warm prefix" row models 75% of the tools+system prefix being cached on the first request — this primarily benefits short conversations where the first-request miss dominates. For longer conversations, the prefix is a small fraction of total tokens and the impact is minimal (~1pp).

## Installation

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for fast, reliable Python package management.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/callanjfox/kv-cache-tester.git
cd kv-cache-tester

# Install dependencies with uv (recommended)
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or with pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify installation
uv run python single_prompt_tester.py --help
```

## Understanding the Metrics

- **TTFT (Time To First Token):** Latency before first token generation - primary metric for cache effectiveness
- **TTLT (Time To Last Token):** Total request completion time
- **ITL (Inter-Token Latency):** Time between generated tokens
- **Input/Output Throughput:** Tokens processed/generated per second
- **Eval Accuracy (only with `--eval-mode niah`):** Fraction of in-band NIAH probes whose embedded passkey was retrieved correctly by the model. A value below 100% indicates wrong or garbage output — typically a sign of KV cache corruption under load. Reported per assessment period; below 100% the line is colored as a warning.

## Output Correctness Eval (NIAH)

`cache_rate_tester.py` supports an optional in-band correctness eval based on
the [needle-in-a-haystack](https://github.com/gkamradt/LLMTest_NeedleInAHaystack)
pattern. It is intended for catching KV cache corruption or other bugs that
produce wrong or garbage output under high concurrency — failures that are
otherwise invisible in pure throughput/latency metrics.

When enabled with `--eval-mode niah`:

- A configurable fraction (default 10%) of the working-set prompts are
  replaced with NIAH probes: an English haystack of the same context length,
  with a random N-digit passkey embedded at a random position inside the
  haystack, followed by a retrieval question.
- Eval probes are interleaved with the regular synthetic prompts in the test
  load, so they exercise the same cache behavior and the same concurrency —
  they are real requests, not a separate phase.
- Each response is graded by substring match against the expected passkey.
  With greedy decoding and a healthy cache, a modern model trivially retrieves
  the passkey, so any drop below 100% is a strong signal that something is
  wrong with the inference path.
- Per-period eval accuracy is logged during the run; per-request results
  (`eval_expected`, `eval_passed`, `eval_response_excerpt`) land in the
  detailed CSV for post-hoc inspection of any failures.

Eval grading only activates at `cache_hit_rate=100`. At mixed cache rates the
tester replaces the prompt's trailing tokens with random gibberish to drive the
desired cache-miss fraction, which would clobber the retrieval question and
break the eval; the gate is enforced automatically.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--eval-mode {none,niah}` | `none` | Set to `niah` to enable. `none` (default) preserves the pre-existing tester behavior. |
| `--eval-fraction FLOAT` | `0.1` | Fraction of the working set replaced with eval probes (e.g., `0.1` with 30 prompts → 3 probes). |
| `--eval-passkey-digits INT` | `7` | Digits in each random passkey. Higher reduces the chance of an incidental substring match in unrelated output. Must be in `[3, 12]`. |

## Testing Methodology

For a detailed guide on testing methodology and how to use these tools effectively, see:
[Evaluating Management of KV Cache within an Inference System](https://medium.com/@callan.j.fox/evaluating-management-of-kv-cache-within-an-inference-system-2d7c3d266c3a)

> **Note:** This guide will be updated soon with the latest methodology covering trace replay testing and multi-endpoint support.

## Real-World Trace Replay

> **Beta:** `trace_replay_tester.py` is currently in beta with active development underway. Updates to come.

The `trace_replay_tester.py` tool replays real agentic coding traces to benchmark inference performance with realistic cache hit patterns, timing, and message structures. See the [Trace Replay Documentation](docs/trace_replay_tester.md) for full details.
